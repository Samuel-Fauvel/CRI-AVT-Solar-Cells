# CRI-AVT-Solar-Cells
Calculate the colour-rendering index (CRI) and the average visible transmission (AVT) of solar cells based on UV-visible spectra

The program uses the library colour-science to obtain CRI and AVT values from the absorption spectra of a transparent solar cell.
The program also gives different coordinates (XYZ, xy and RGB), creates PNG files with UV-visible spectra or detailed CRI analysis and writes csv files with treated UV-visible spectra.

The program was developed for the raw csv files obtained with our UV-visible measurement apparatus and will probably need to be adapted depending on the needs.
